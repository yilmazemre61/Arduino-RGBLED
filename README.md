# Arduino-RGBLED
Level-2-- Create your own personalized 15 second light show. You need to use at least 3 different time variables between 500 and 1000 ms. 
Add comments every 5 seconds of your light show.
Level-3-- Slow the Lights Down Challenge - Modify the program to progressively cycle through each of the colors 7 colors and have it get slower each time. 
For example, start at a rate of cycling all 7 colors in 1 second then after 10 cycles cycling it will take 10 seconds to complete the cycle. 
You should use a ​for loop​ to complete this task. There will be a bit of math to figure out how much the delay should increase by each cycle.
